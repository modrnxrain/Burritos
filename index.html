  <h1><em>burritos are amazing</em></h1>
<p>There are so many reasons as to why i could convince you to go out and get a well made burrito. though some burritos are amazing at places like taco good or tace bueno or even taco bell some of the best are homemade.The word burrito means "little donkey" in Spanish, as a diminutive form of burro, or "donkey". The name burrito as applied to the dish possibly derives from the appearance of bedrolls and packs that donkeys carried.[4]

The word "burrito" appears in the Dictionary of Mexicanisms from 1895. It is the term used in the regional area of Guanajuato to describe a "Tortilla rolled, with meat or other food within, that in Yucatan is known as coçito, and Cuernavaca and Mexico, as taco."[5] Having been published in 1895, this fact discredits the etymology that notes the origin of the "burrito" during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1921) in the City of Cuidad Juarez by Juan Méndez.Before the development of the modern burrito, the Mesoamerican peoples of Mexico used corn tortillas to wrap foods, with fillings of chili peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, squash, and avocados.[6] The Pueblo people of the Southwestern United States also made tortillas with beans and meat sauce fillings prepared much like the modern burrito.[7]

The precise origin of the modern burrito is not known. However, it is generally believed to have originated in the Mexican-American community. Some have speculated that it may have originated with vaqueros in northern Mexico in the nineteenth century.[6][8] Many have traced its roots to the farmworkers of the fields in California's Central Valley, in Fresno and Stockton.[9] Farmworkers that picked many of the Central Valley's agriculture would prepare lunches in the fields consisting of homemade flour tortillas, beans and salsa picante or hot sauce. Other farmworkers would prepare their burritos at home and wrap them in foil wrap[dubious – discuss] and place them in the sun so they could warm up. In the 1895 Diccionario de Mexicanismos, the burrito was identified as a regional item from Guanajuato and defined as "Tortilla arrollada, con carne u otra cosa dentro, que en Yucatán llaman coçito, y en Cuernavaca y en Mexico, taco" (A rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside, called 'coçito' in Yucatán and 'taco' in the city of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City).[8][10]

An often-repeated folk history is that of a man named Juan Méndez who sold tacos in a street stand in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Ciudad Juárez, using a donkey as a transport for himself and the food, during the Mexican Revolution period (1910–1921).[11] To keep the food warm, Méndez wrapped it in large homemade flour tortillas underneath a small tablecloth. As the "food of the burrito" (i.e., "food of the little donkey") grew in popularity, "burrito" was eventually adopted as the name for these large tacos.[6]

Another creation story comes from 1940s Ciudad Juárez, where a street food vendor created the tortilla-wrapped food to sell to poor children at a state-run middle school. The vendor would call the children his burritos, as burro is a colloquial term for dunce or dullard. Eventually, the derogatory or endearing term for the children was transferred to the food they ate.[6]

In 1923, Alejandro Borquez opened the Sonora cafe in Los Angeles, which later changed its name to the El Cholo Spanish Cafe.[12] Burritos first appeared on American restaurant menus at the El Cholo Spanish Cafe during the 1930s.[13] Burritos were mentioned in the U.S. media for the first time in 1934,[14] appearing in the Mexican Cookbook, a collection of regional recipes from New Mexico authored by historian Erna Fergusson.[15

In other regions of Mexico such as in the state of Tamaulipas, similar types of food are known as "flauta" (flute).</p>
