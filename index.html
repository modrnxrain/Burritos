  <h1><em>burritos are amazing</em></h1>
<p>There are so many reasons as to why i could convince you to go out and get a well made burrito. though some burritos are amazing at places like taco good or tace bueno or even taco bell some of the best are homemade.The word burrito means "little donkey" in Spanish, as a diminutive form of burro, or "donkey". The name burrito as applied to the dish possibly derives from the appearance of bedrolls and packs that donkeys carried.[4]

The word "burrito" appears in the Dictionary of Mexicanisms from 1895. It is the term used in the regional area of Guanajuato to describe a "Tortilla rolled, with meat or other food within, that in Yucatan is known as coçito, and Cuernavaca and Mexico, as taco."[5] Having been published in 1895, this fact discredits the etymology that notes the origin of the "burrito" during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1921) in the City of Cuidad Juarez by Juan Méndez.

In other regions of Mexico such as in the state of Tamaulipas, similar types of food are known as "flauta" (flute).</p>
